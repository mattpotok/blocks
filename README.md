## Notes

The documentation assumes the following configuration structure for i3blocks:

``` 
└── ~/.config/i3blocks/  # i3blocks configuration directory
    ├── bin/             # directory with blocklet binaries
    ├── cfg/             # directory with blocklet configurations
    ├── blocks.log       # log file for blocklets
    └── config           # i3blocks configuration file
```

The paths above can be configured as you see fit.
