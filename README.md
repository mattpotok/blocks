# Blocks

A collection of personal i3 blocklets for [i3blocks][1].

| Blocklet | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [battery](battery) | Display battery information |
| [weather](weather) | Display current local weather forecast |

## Notes

The individual documentation for the blocklets assumes that all blocklet
binaries will be copied to `~/.config/i3blocks/bin` and any required
configuration files will be copied to `~/.config/i3blocks/cfg`. These two paths
can be changed as you see fit.
